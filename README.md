Customer Churn Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

A complete end-to-end Customer Churn Prediction System built using Python and Machine Learning on Google Colab.
The goal of this project is to identify customers who are likely to churn and provide actionable business insights to reduce churn.

🚀 Project Overview

This project analyzes telecom customer data, preprocesses it, builds ML models, evaluates performance, and generates business insights using SHAP explainability.

Key Objectives:

Predict customer churn using ML algorithms

Understand factors that contribute to churn

Perform segment-level analysis

Provide actionable recommendations for retention teams
